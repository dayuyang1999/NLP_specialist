# DeepLearning.ai NLP Specialization Courses Notes
This repository contains my personal notes on [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) NLP specialization courses.

[DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) contains four courses which can be taken on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing). In this repo, I only select Natural Language Processing with Attention Models. This the NLP world has been dominated by attention-based models. Almost all SOTA method is achieved by this category of methods.
